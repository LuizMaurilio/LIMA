# L.I.M.A. Leaf Image Measurement and Analysis

Mobile version of the proposed method. This work aims to develop a simple and low-cost method capable of accurately measuring the leaf surface size of plant species with significant agricultural interest. Our method extract the information through images of leaves accompanied by a scale pattern whose real area is known, captured by a simple camera.
